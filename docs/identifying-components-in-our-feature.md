# Identifying components in our feature

When breaking down the feature, we should consider the potential for reuse. If we can identify components that could be reused in other features, we should extract them into their own components.

For example, the card component that we identified in the previous section could be reused in other features. We should extract it into its own component.

We can also see something as small as a badge component that could be reused in other features. We should extract it into its own component, so let's do that.
